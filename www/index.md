The goal of SDG Translations is to compile text related to the United Nation's
[Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/),
translate it into as many languages as possible, and then provide those translations in both machine-readable and human-readable formats.

## Machine-readable

This project was built to support SDG reporting platforms, by making it easier to translate those platforms into multiple languages. So accomplish this, the translations are available in machine-readable JSON format. For more technical information, see the [developers page]({{ site.baseurl }}/developers).

## Human-readable

In order to make it easy to audit and expand this set of translations, this project also provides some user-friendly tools for translators. On the [translators page]({{ site.baseurl }}/translators) there are spreadsheets available for each language. Additionally there is a [search page]({{ site.baseurl }}/search) where translators can look up particular items to get more detailed context about how a word/phrase is intended to be used.

## Contibuting and forking

Forking of this repository is encouraged, especially for maintaining translations that are specific to a particular platform. However any useful translations are welcome to be contributed back, as "pull requests". If you are unsure how to submit a pull request, simply start things off with a note in the [issue queue](https://github.com/OpenDataEnterprise/sdg-translations/issues).
