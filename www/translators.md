## Exports for translation audits

The translations for the current languages are available in spreadsheet form for ease of translation audits. The spreadsheets avaiable include:
* [Spanish]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/sdg-translations-es.csv)
* [French]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/sdg-translations-fr.csv)
* [Chinese]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/sdg-translations-zh.csv)

In these spreadsheets the English translations sit in a column alongside the translations for the target language, if any.

The purpose of this is to facilitate an audit of the translations, or to faciliate the translation process itself. After the spreadsheet has been audited/completed by a translator (such as in Excel), it can be re-imported into this repository - see below.

## New languages

Along the same lines as the exports mentioned above, there is a "blank" export available to help with new languages. That spreadsheet is available [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/sdg-translations-blank.csv).

## Importing

An exported spreadsheet can be re-imported back into the repository, after having been edited. More technical information is available in the [developers]({{ site.baseurl }}/developers) section.
